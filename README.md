#  AtaraxiaSDK
Welcome to AtaraxiaSDK, an SDK with a lot of essential features that are designed to make implementation much easier.

The goal of a project like this is to have everything very modular, so you can build what you need. This is not perfect
as a project, mostly because I've set things up in relative to the projects I write with this.

This means that there are a lot of approaches that may need additional fixes depending on how you utilize the pre-built
functions. You must understand that this schema works, meaning that the more you strafe away from it with your code
logic, the more likely that you've broken something that needs specific code to work.

Basic functionality like text, screens, custom color data, and databases, were all included for the sake of you having a good start.
This is not meant as a total solution in which you can plug and play, however, I hope that it can serve these interests one of these days.
Coding is fucking hard, and SDL3 is no joke.
